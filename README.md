Random Password Generator

This is a tool that generates a random password based on selected complexity options (length, lower/upper cases, numerals, and special characters), and copies the generated value to the user's clipboard. This can help users get more secure passwords between 8 and 128 characters, that are not based on predictable things (birthdays, children's names, etc.) so that their accounts can be more secure. 

Using the generator is pretty straightforward. Navigate to the URL, select the length of the password with the slider, select at least one option from the checkboxes under the slider, then click "Generate." Your new password will be in the text box above. Then, you can either click the "Copy" button to copy the password to your clipboard, or highlight and copy (right-click and copy, or ctrl-c).
